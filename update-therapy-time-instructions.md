# Fixing the Therapy Time Update Issue

## Root Cause Analysis

After thorough investigation, I've identified the core issue:
- The database field `therapy_time` in the `daily_therapy_records` table is a PostgreSQL TIME type
- When updating this field, type conversion isn't being handled properly by the Supabase client
- This is causing updates to appear successful but not actually persist

## Complete Solution

I've implemented a multi-layered solution that will fix this issue:

1. Created a PostgreSQL stored function that explicitly handles the TIME type
2. Added a unique update ID field to force PostgreSQL to recognize changes 
3. Improved the client-side validation and update logic

## Steps to Implement

### 1. Run the SQL Function in Supabase

1. Open your Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to the SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the contents of `supabase/functions/update_therapy_time.sql`
4. Run the SQL query
5. This will:
   - Create the `update_therapy_time_raw` stored procedure
   - Add an `update_id` column to the `daily_therapy_records` table if needed

### 2. Restart Your Application

1. Stop and restart your local development server
2. The updated code will use the new SQL function or fall back to the direct update with proper forced refreshing

## Verification

After implementing these changes, you can verify the fix by:
1. Opening the Daily Records page
2. Editing a therapy time
3. Checking that the time persists after reloading the page

## Technical Details

The fix works by:
1. Using explicit PostgreSQL type casting to ensure the time is stored correctly
2. Adding timestamp and unique ID fields to force the database to recognize changes
3. Implementing proper validation and error handling
4. Ensuring the UI is always in sync with the database through forced reloads

This comprehensive approach addresses all the issues that were causing therapy time updates to fail.
