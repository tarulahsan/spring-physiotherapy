-- This script will help identify missing therapy types and create placeholder entries for them
-- Step 1: First, let's identify all therapy_type_ids that exist in daily_therapy_records but not in therapy_types
WITH missing_therapy_types AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT dtr.therapy_type_id
  FROM daily_therapy_records dtr
  LEFT JOIN therapy_types tt ON dtr.therapy_type_id = tt.id
  WHERE tt.id IS NULL
    AND dtr.therapy_type_id IS NOT NULL
)

-- Step 2: This will print the missing IDs for review
SELECT therapy_type_id AS missing_therapy_id
FROM missing_therapy_types
ORDER BY therapy_type_id;

-- Step 3: Insert placeholder entries for the missing therapy types
-- IMPORTANT: Uncomment the following INSERT statement to actually fix the database
/*
INSERT INTO therapy_types (id, name, description, price, created_at, updated_at)
SELECT 
  therapy_type_id, 
  'Therapy Type ' || SUBSTR(therapy_type_id::text, 1, 8) AS name,
  'Auto-generated therapy type placeholder' AS description,
  0 AS price,
  NOW() AS created_at,
  NOW() AS updated_at
FROM missing_therapy_types;
*/

-- After running this script and reviewing the results, uncomment the INSERT statement 
-- to add placeholders for the missing therapy types. Then you can update them with proper names.
